...Move all ‘x’ to the end of the string...
Base Case: If the string is empty:
return “ “;

If the current character ch is ‘x’, we add the resultant string + ch,
Else we return ch + resultant string
Time Complexity: O(N

Space Complexity: O(N
2
) [IMP]
Time complexity will be O(N
2
) because s.substr(i) takes O(N) times and it is called

O(N) times.
Space complexity will be O(N
2
) because s.substr(i) gives a string of O(N) size and it

is called O(N) times.
FollowUp: Try to do this in O(N) time and space. Hint: Pass by reference and
indices.
