Objective: To print the string in reverse.
Base Case: If the string is empty:
return;

Reverse print the remaining string using recursion, and print then print the
current character.
Time Complexity: O(N
2
) [IMP]
Space Complexity: O(N
2
) [IMP]
Time complexity will be O(N
2
) because s.substr(i) takes O(N) times and it is called

O(N) times.
Space complexity will be O(N
2
) because s.substr(i) gives a string of O(N) size and it

is called O(N) times.
FollowUp: Try to do this in O(N) time and space. Hint: Pass by reference and
indices.
