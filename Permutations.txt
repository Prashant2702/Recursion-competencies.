Permutation
To print all the permutations of a string.
Idea: for each character s[i] in the given string, we add a character in the ans
string and then solve solve s.substr(0,i) + s.substr(i+1)
Sample Input:
ABC
Sample Output:
ABC
ACB
BAC
BCA
CAB
CBA

Time Complexity: O(N*2^n).
Space Complexity: O(2^n).
