...Remove Duplicates...
Base Case: If the string is empty: //no duplicates

return “”;

If the current character ch is ‘x’, we return resultant string + ch,
Else we return ch + resultant string
Time Complexity: O(N

)
Space Complexity: O(N
2
)
Time complexity will be O(N
2
) because s.substr(i) takes O(N) times and it is called

O(N) times.
Space complexity will be O(N
2
) because s.substr(i) gives a string of O(N) size and it

is called O(N) times.
